![How far I got through the book so far](https://badgen.net/github/tag/marnix/zig-ray-tracer-challenge-marnix)]

Today, November 8, 2023, "The Ray Tracer Challenge --
A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer"
arrived in the mail.

And in this repository I plan to implement it in Zig, to

- hone my Zig skills,
- learn something new,
- have a side project that I always can make progress on,
- and experiencing that TDD buzz.

Initially this will be in Zig 0.11.0,
but I plan to upgrade to newer Zig stable releases.

I'm not yet sure how closely I will follow the book,
and how many of the 'Putting It Together' projects I will do, if any.
